# Rendered Worklog

This repository repository contains the rendered worklog.json file. Since it is on the __gh-pages__ branch, it gets hosted via GitHub Pages.
My personal site loads my worklog data from here.

The worklog generation is automated with Travis CI based on this article: http://ricostacruz.com/cheatsheets/travis-gh-pages.html
